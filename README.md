REST API endpoint that provides auto-complete suggestions for large cities

Greetings!!

The next project shows a simple REST API endpoint that gives the user auto-complete suggestions for some large cities in USA. 


For the correct deveplopment of this API you will need a server. 
In this particular case, we use the server includes in Visual Studio Code, its name is "Live Server", you can download it from "Extensions Menu". 
That is everything you need, and of course, an internet connection.

1. Once the program is open, write a letter in the textbox to see the different cities named on the list.
2. Check his latitude and longitude
3. Besides the name of the city, you can also confirm his capital.
